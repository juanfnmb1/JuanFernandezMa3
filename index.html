              I am originally from Havana Cuba. I migrated with my parents to
              the United States in 2007 with no more than a bookbag. I didn't
              speak fluent English, but I learned fast.

              My tech journey started in Middle School. I built my first video
              game when I was 12 years old! It was called Mortal Kombat VS
              Street Fighter. I also took two Honors IT classes, and saw that IT
              related subjects really caught my attention.

              My freshman year of High School, I created made my own Youtube
              Channel! I also took an Adobe Photoshop class that year out of
              curiosity. I loved it so much that ended up taking an IT class for
              every subsequent year of High School! These included Graphic
              Design, and Video Production classes.

              After I graduated, I continued my studies at UCF because it is a
              good school and it is close to home. My major used to be in
              Computer Science. I realized though, that it requires lots of
              math! I therefore, wanted to find an IT related career where not
              too much mas was needed. I switched to a Digital Media major with
              a Game Design track!

              My sophmore year of college, I had a cousin teach me how to build
              a website just for fun. I started to build websites for my family
              and then for small local businesses. I realized that I liked
              building websites more than I did games. Which brought me to my
              current state as a Junior UCF student with a Web Design track.
